# hello-world
Greetings from Florida!

One aspect that I love about getting into computer science is working with keyboards. 
I began to love pressing the keys when I was in high school and found that I'm some what good at it.
So far I'm getting the hang of things around here; I've found that Java has been easier for me to learn than Python programming language, however, some aspects of C++ are easier than both Python and Java, while other concepts are still challenging to master.
